    <p><b>What the project does.</b></p>
    <p>
      This webpage calculates your age using the birthdate you provided. It compares your birthdate and the current date. After getting the year, it checks if your birth month has already passed and if it hasn’t, it subtracts one from your age, if it has, it leaves it alone.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>How it could be used in your final business website.</b></p>
    <p>
      During the account creation process, we would ask for the user’s birthdate. In theory we would use this information to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to avoid collecting data and personalizing ads for children under 13 years old, but since we’re not doing that, this will just be using this information to display on their profiles <i>(if they enable it)</i>.
    </p>

      Understanding how to calculate the user’s age if they haven’t had their birthdays this year. The if statement in the <b>getAge()</b> function helped me wrap my head around it.

    <p>
      This could be used as the search bar for the business website. It adds animations to spice it up. Although, the original animation was too slow for my liking so I sped it up. I also changed the microphone icon into the Google icon because there is no speak to search feature.
